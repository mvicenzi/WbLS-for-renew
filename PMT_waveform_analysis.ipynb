    "# PMT Waveform Analysis\n",
    "**ICARUS** is a liquid argon detector currently in operation at Fermilab as part of the Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program. It consists of two symmetric modules, acting as large time-projection chambers (TPCs). Each of them houses 180 PMTs that collect scintillation light produced by charged particles crossing the liquid argon volume.\n",

    "\n",
    "The photon detection system in ICARUS serves two primary purposes:\n",
    "1.   **Triggering**: It allows to trigger on interesting events by setting a threshold on the amount of collected light.\n",
    "2.   **Timing**: it provides accurate timing information on the event, i.e. the time of the neutrino interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through a low-level analysis of PMT data taken at the ICARUS experiment. You will be looking at 180 PMT waveforms coming from a specific triggered event (run 9435, event 14386) in one of the ICARUS modules. You will start by looking at a few waveforms, explore a way to tag relevant light activity across all PMTs and extract a rough estimation of the position and time of the event.\n",
